         - `self.create_snapshot` (bool) indicates when a snapshot is created

            Motivation: Only one snapshot per summary interval is reported by
            the summary hook for each snapshot type (e.g., images, audios, ...).
            You can use this flag to avoid unnecessary computations

    sense with `torch.nn.Module`: init=True, repr=False, eq=False. `repr` and
    `eq` should be handled by `torch`.

    `torch.nn.Module` is implemented in a way that its `__init__` has to be
    called before any torch-specific attributes can be set. `dataclass`
    manipulates `__init__` to set instance attributes without calling
    `super().__init__`, so both can, by default, not be used in conjunction.
    This decorator modifies the `__init__` generated by the `dataclass`
    decorator so that it calls `torch.nn.Module.__init__` before setting
    instance attributes.
